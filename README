As part of trialling some cheap switches, we want at least a method to 
automatically download the current running config.  This repository
contains a quick and dirty proof-of-concept that such a tool is easy
to write.

This would allow version control and alerting on changes, as well as
potentially allowing checks against templates.

Once downloaded, the config file is visually similar to Cisco IOS - in fact,
the switch appears to use a customised version of Quagga under the hood.

A way to upload single line changes would be nice, but the only option appears
to be to send the whole file - which then causes the switch to reboot to load
the config.

Tested against
    ZyxEL GS1900-24 with firmware 2.40(AAHL.0)C0
    ZyxEL GS1900-8HP with firmware V2.60(AAHI.2)
