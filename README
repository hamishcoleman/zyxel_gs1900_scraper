As part of trialling some cheap switches, we want at least a method to 
automatically download the current running config.

This would allow version control and alerting on changes, as well as
potentially allowing checks against templates.

A way to upload single line changes would be nice, but the only option appears
to be to send the whole file - which then causes the switch to reboot to load
the config.

Tested against
    ZyxEL GS1900-24 with firmware 2.40(AAHL.0)C0
